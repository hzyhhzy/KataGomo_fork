-------------------------------
# Brief introduction of recent branches (Latest update: 2024.8.21)
## Basic branches for fast modification to all kinds of games
### BWN2024
"Black-white No-score 2024"
For games which black and white plays alternately
### Movestone2024
For board games with multi-stage moves or irregular move order
For example: Chess(regard one move as two stages: choose and place), Amazons(3 stages), Ataxx(sometimes 1 stage, some times 2 stages), ConnectSix, ...

## Gomoku (Freestyle or Standard) and Renju
### Gom2024
Latest KataGo engine for Gomoku and Renju. Also called "KataGomo" and "KataGomoku".     
Recently a b28c512nbt net is training under the sponsorship of Zhizi(智子)(www.zhizigo.cn www.zhizigomoku.cn), which provides online paid KataGo services.   
The training started in 2024.5 and will finish in 2024.11. ~30\*RTX4090 for 10 hours every day. The strongest net is only available on Zhizi.      

### Gom2024NNUE
An experiment of combining NNUE and NN. (not very success)
Gomoku-NNUE: A fast and small network with special structure for gomoku.      
Gomoku-NNUE is firstly created by me (https://github.com/hzyhhzy/gomoku_nnue/tree/multiRules) and improved by dblue and used in Rapfi(https://github.com/dhbloo/rapfi)     
Input the result of a small MCTS (~300 nodes) of NNUE to the big katago net.   
Result:  The katago net become "as strong as NNUE+MCTS" in a very short time, however further progress is very slow.
If use transfer-training from a trained katago net, it become slightly stronger than the origin net with same nodes, but not worth its large CPU cost.

### GomNNUEnested
A branch to test MCTS of NNUE.
Regarding the result of a small MCTS (~300 nodes) of NNUE as a "meta-node", then apply MCTS to meta-nodes.
Katago NN is not used here. Only to use katago's MCTS


## Hex and related problems
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_(board_game)   

### Hex2024Maxmove
Latest KataHex code
Hex2024 with move limit settings, to estimate the length of the optimal game of Hex board on N\*N board   
Result: f(N) ~ 0.6 \* N^1.9   
https://mathoverflow.net/questions/302821/length-of-optimal-play-in-hex-as-a-function-of-size/477037#477037

### Hex2024
Latest release of Katago for Hex game (KataHex)
https://github.com/hzyhhzy/KataGo/releases/tag/Hex_20240812   

### HexTemplate
A special engine for "edge template". Special network is needed.   
This branch is to estimate the min width of 8~11th row "edge template" of Hex     
Result: f(n)>=9\*n-46 for n>=8, and probably f(n)=9\*n-46 for n<=11   
https://www.hexwiki.net/index.php/Open_problems_about_edge_templates   

### HexTemplateSolver
A special engine for single-stone escape problems (HexTemplate branch is more specific for "edge template"). Special network is needed.    
Some analysis and results: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/470376/connection-properties-of-a-single-stone-on-an-infinite-hex-board   


## Other Gomoku-like Games
Including Caro, ConnectSix, and maybe some math problems

### ConnectSix2024
KataGo for Connect Six
The 2022 ver has shown that black has great advantage on 21x21 or larger boards, but 19x19 was unknown.
Recently @eeoo has found that black has advantage on 19x19, so I started a new run in 2024.8.
I decide to strictly prove that black wins in Connect Six on 19x19 boards, collaborating with dblue using his ConnectSix Rapfi.

### Caro2024
Caro is a modified Gomoku rule, the only difference is that fives with two terminals blocked are not a win (OXXXXXO is not a win)   
Latest release: https://github.com/hzyhhzy/KataGo/releases/tag/Caro_20240804

### ProveSevenInARow
We all know black wins in 5-in-a-row(Gomoku) on an infinite board. And more than 5 in a row is very difficult which means easy to draw.   
Although it's very easy even for a beginner to draw in 6-in-a-row game, 7-in-a-row has not been proven to be a draw in infinite boards and remains to be an open problem for decades, showing a big gap between "theory" and "practice".   
https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05363 This article shows a method to reduce the infinite board to 4\*n boards. If we can prove that there exist such one n, that white can draw on a 4\*n board (with some kinds of rules), then "7-in-a-row is a draw" is proved.  In this article the authors tried n<=14 but failed.    
This branch is to solve the game mentioned in this article on 4\*n boards with large n.     
However katago shows that the min n is around 30, which means it is almost impossible to strictly solve the 4\*n game. So this method is almost dead.    
More details was written here: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/471302/can-gomokufive-in-a-row-draw-on-an-infinite-board-what-about-other-m-n-k-game     

## Other games
### DotsAndBoxes
It's a game that black and white alternately play edges. It is hard to represent edges in Katago, so I uses a (2H-1)\*(2W-1) board to represent the Dots-and-boxes board
Result: This is a very chaotic game, no strategies, just brute-force search. (probably because it is almost an "impartical game"). Katago can learn almost nothing in the first 1/3 game and there is only some strategies near the end of the game

***Updated on 2021.4.5***
Now ***Gomoku/Renju*** code is uploading in "Gomoku" branch.




----------- 2020.7.26 ----------

Now there are gomoku(freestyle,standard,renju,caro), reversi, connect6, breakthrough, hex, "four in a row", Chinese checkers, and many board games few people play.

Now it's the strongest program on this games as I know: 
all kinds of gomoku(compared with Embryo)
connect6(compared with gzero)
hex(compared with gzero and)
Chinese checkers(compared with Shangxin Tiaoqi)
